      "Salidroside Attenuates Cognitive Dysfunction in Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Prone 8 ( SAMP8 ) Mice and Modulates Inflammation of the Gut-Brain Axis . Background : Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss . However , several therapeutic approaches have shown unsatisfactory outcomes in the clinical setting . Thus , developing alternative therapies for the prevention and treatment of AD is critical . Salidroside ( SAL ) is critical , an herb-derived phenylpropanoid glycoside compound , has been shown to attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cognitive impairment . However , the mechanism underlying its neuroprotective effects remains unclear . Here , we show that SAL has a therapeutic effect in the senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 ( SAMP8 ) strain , a reliable and stable mouse model of AD . Methods : SAMP8 mice were treated with SAL , donepezil ( DNP ) or saline , and cognitive behavioral impairments were assessed using the Morris water maze ( MWM ) , Y maze , and open field test ( OFT ) . Fecal samples were collected and analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq system . Brain samples were analyzed to detect beta-amyloid ( Abeta ) 1 - 42 ( Abeta1 - 42 ) deposition by immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) and western blotting . The activation of microglia and neuroinflammatory cytokines was detected by immunofluorescence ( IF ) , western blotting and qPCR . Serum was analyzed by a Mouse High Sensitivity T Cell Magnetic Bead Panel on a Luminex-MAGPIX multiplex immunoassay system . Results : Our results suggest that SAL effectively alleviated hippocampus-dependent memory impairment in the SAMP8 mice . SAL significantly 1 ) reduced toxic Abeta1 - 42 deposition ; 2 ) reduced microglial activation and attenuated the levels of the proinflammatory factors IL-1beta , IL-6 , and TNF-alpha in the brain ; 3 ) improved the gut barrier integrity and modified the gut microbiota ( reversed the ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes and eliminated Clostridiales and Streptococcaceae , which may be associated with cognitive deficits ) ; and 4 ) decreased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines , particularly IL-1alpha , IL-6 , @GeneSrc$ and IL-12 , in the peripheral circulation , as determined by a multiplex immunoassay . Conclusion : In summary , SAL reversed AD-related changes in SAMP8 mice , potentially by regulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis and modulating @DiseaseTgt$ in both the peripheral circulation and central nervous system . Our results strongly suggest that SAL has a preventive effect on cognition-related changes in SAMP8 mice and highlight its value as a potential agent for drug development .\n"

      "Systemic infection exacerbates cerebrovascular dysfunction in Alzheimer 's disease . We studied the effects of systemic infection on brain cytokine level and cerebral vascular function in Alzheimer 's disease and vascular dementia , in superior temporal cortex ( Brodmann area 22 ) from Alzheimer 's disease patients ( n = 75 ) , vascular dementia patients ( n = 22 ) and age-matched control subjects ( n = 46 ) , stratified according to the presence or absence of terminal systemic infection . Brain cytokine levels were measured using Mesoscale Discovery Multiplex Assays and markers of cerebrovascular function were assessed by ELISA . Multiple brain cytokines were elevated in Alzheimer 's disease and vascular dementia : IL-15 and IL-17A were maximally elevated in end-stage Alzheimer 's disease ( Braak tangle stage V-VI ) whereas IL-2 , IL-5 , IL12p40 and IL-16 were highest in intermediate Braak tangle stage III-IV disease . Several cytokines ( IL-1beta , IL-6 , TNF-alpha , IL-8 and IL-15 ) were further raised in Alzheimer 's disease with systemic infection . Cerebral hypoperfusion-indicated by decreased MAG : PLP1 and increased vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF)-and blood-brain barrier leakiness , indicated by raised levels of fibrinogen , were exacerbated in Alzheimer 's disease and vascular dementia patients , and also in non-dementia controls , with systemic infection . Amyloid-beta42 level did not vary with infection or in association with brain cytokine levels . In controls , cortical perfusion declined with increasing IFN-gamma , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-10 , IL-12p70 , IL-13 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) but these relationships were lost with progression of Alzheimer 's disease , and with infection ( even in Braak stage 0-II brains ) . Cortical platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta ( PDGFRbeta ) , a pericyte marker , was reduced , and endothelin-1 ( EDN1 ) level was increased in Alzheimer 's disease ; these were related to @GeneSrc$ level and disease progression and only modestly affected by systemic infection . Our findings indicate that systemic infection alters brain cytokine levels and exacerbates @DiseaseTgt$ associated with Alzheimer 's disease and vascular dementia , independently of the level of insoluble @GeneSrc$ , and highlight systemic infection as an important contributor to dementia , requiring early identification and treatment in the elderly population .\n"
