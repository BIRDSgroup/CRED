# CRED
Causal Relation Extraction Dataset on Genes-Diseases based on biomedical literature data

We have organised this repository as: code, data, embeddings, intermediate results, pre_trained_models.

In "code" folder, 
classification_code contains the code for generating the embeddings using BioBERT model and generating the predictions.
 
We have provided the pre-trained SVM and XgBoost models on CRED and CDR data in "pre_trained_models" folder.
Embeddings of training and test data are provided in "embeddings" folder.
Some intermediate results like importance scores are needed to generate the plots. These files are provided in "intermediate_results" folder.
